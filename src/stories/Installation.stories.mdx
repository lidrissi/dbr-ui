# Welcome to DBR ui library

DBR ui library helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop. 

## Setup

- 1 Add to package.json:

```json
  "dbr-ui": "https://github.com/lidrissi/dbr-ui.git#0.1.0"
```

Note: you can change the version

- 2 Include the css file to the global style

```js
  @import "dbr-ui/build/css/main.css";
```

- 3 Start using components

Ex: Dashboard component :

```js
import { Dashboard } from "dbr-ui";

<Dashboard
 id='615dac10b0e71057228737f0' 
 env="demo"/> ;
```
## Components list : 

- Dashboard
- DashboardList
- DashboardItem
- WidgetWrapper
